      "&lt;p&gt;Our military systems are &lt;a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dire-possibility-cyberattacks-weapons-systems/\"&gt;vulnerable&lt;/a&gt;. We need to face that reality by halting the purchase of insecure weapons and support systems and by incorporating the realities of offensive cyberattacks into our military planning.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, militaries have established &lt;a href=\"https://www.cybercom.mil/\"&gt;cyber commands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/16/next-world-war-wont-be-anything-like-last-heres-how-us-must-prepare/\"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/parliamentary-documents/2019/09/26/letter-to-the-parliament-on-the-international-legal-order-in-cyberspace/International+Law+in+the+Cyberdomain+-+Netherlands.pdf\"&gt;cyberwar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/french-application-of-international-rules-to-cyberwarfare/\"&gt;doctrine&lt;/a&gt;. However, much of the current discussion is about offense. Increasing our offensive capabilities without being able to secure them is like having all the best guns in the world, and then storing them in an unlocked, unguarded armory. They just won&amp;#8217;t be stolen; they&amp;#8217;ll be subverted.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;During that same period, we&amp;#8217;ve seen &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html\"&gt;increasingly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/10/1020596/how-chinas-attack-on-microsoft-escalated-into-a-reckless-hacking-spree/\"&gt;brazen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/11/israel-appears-confirm-cyberattack-iran-nuclear-facility\"&gt;cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/global-consequences-escalating-us-russia-cyber-conflict\"&gt;everyone&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-darkside-criminal-gang/\"&gt;criminals&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/26/the-incredible-rise-of-north-koreas-hacking-army\"&gt;governments&lt;/a&gt;. Everything is now a computer, and those computers &lt;a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/01/the-internet-of-things-dangerous-future-bruce-schneier.html\"&gt;are vulnerable&lt;/a&gt;. Cars, medical devices, power plants, and fuel pipelines have all been targets. Military computers, whether they&amp;#8217;re embedded inside weapons systems or on desktops managing the logistics of those weapons systems, are similarly vulnerable. We could see effects as stodgy as making a tank impossible to start up, or sophisticated as retargeting a missile midair.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Military software is unlikely to be any more secure than commercial software. Although sensitive military systems rely on domestically manufactured chips as part of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.dmea.osd.mil/TrustedIC.aspx\"&gt;Trusted Foundry&lt;/a&gt; program, many military systems contain the same foreign chips and code that commercial systems do: just like everyone around the world uses the same mobile phones, networking equipment, and computer operating systems. For example, there has been &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/us/politics/barr-5g.html\"&gt;serious concern&lt;/a&gt; over Chinese-made 5G networking equipment that might be used by China to install &amp;#8220;back doors&amp;#8221; that would allow the equipment to be controlled. This is just one of many risks to our normal civilian computer &lt;a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/broken-trust-lessons-from-sunburst/\"&gt;supply chains&lt;/a&gt;. And since military software is vulnerable to the same cyberattacks as commercial software, military supply chains have many of the same risks.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;This is not speculative. A &lt;a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-128.pdf\"&gt;2018 GAO report&lt;/a&gt; expressed concern regarding the lack of secure and patchable U.S. weapons systems. The report observed that &amp;#8220;in operational testing, the [Department of Defense] routinely found mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in systems that were under development, yet program officials GAO met with believed their systems were secure and discounted some test results as unrealistic.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s a similar attitude to corporate executives who believe that they can&amp;#8217;t be hacked &amp;#8212; and equally naive.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-179.pdf\"&gt;updated GAO report&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this year found some improvements, but the basic problem remained: &amp;#8220;DOD is still learning how to contract for cybersecurity in weapon systems, and selected programs we reviewed have struggled to incorporate systems&amp;#8217; cybersecurity requirements into contracts.&amp;#8221; While DOD now appears aware of the issue of lack of cybersecurity requirements, they&amp;#8217;re still not sure yet how to fix it, and in three of the five cases GAO reviewed, DOD simply chose to not include the requirements at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Militaries around the world are now exploiting these vulnerabilities in weapons systems to carry out operations. When Israel in 2007 bombed a Syrian nuclear reactor, the raid was preceded by what is believed to have been &lt;a href=\"https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/101001_ieee_insert.pdf\"&gt;a cyber attack&lt;/a&gt; on Syrian air defenses that resulted in radar screens showing no threat as bombers zoomed overhead. In 2018, a 29-country NATO exercise, &lt;a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/157833.htm\"&gt;Trident Juncture&lt;/a&gt;, that included cyberweapons was &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/14/politics/russia-nato-jamming/index.html\"&gt;disrupted&lt;/a&gt; by Russian GPS jamming. NATO does try to test cyberweapons outside such exercises, but has limited scope in doing so. In May, Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary-general, &lt;a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/enemy-hackers-target-nato-with-constant-cyberattacks-dj263x2lh\"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;#8220;NATO computer systems are facing almost daily cyberattacks.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The war of the future will not only be about explosions, but will also be about disabling the systems that make armies run. It&amp;#8217;s not (solely) that bases will get blown up; it&amp;#8217;s that some bases will lose power, data, and communications. It&amp;#8217;s not that self-driving trucks will suddenly go mad and begin rolling over friendly soldiers; it&amp;#8217;s that they&amp;#8217;ll casually roll off roads or into water where they sit, rusting, and in need of repair. It&amp;#8217;s not that targeting systems on guns will be retargeted to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; it&amp;#8217;s that many of them could simply turn off and not turn back on again.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;So, how do we prepare for this next war? First, militaries need to introduce a little anarchy into their planning. Let&amp;#8217;s have wargames where essential systems malfunction or are subverted­not all of the time, but randomly. To help combat siloed military thinking, include some civilians as well. Allow their ideas into the room when predicting potential enemy action. And militaries need to have well-developed backup plans, for when systems are subverted. In Joe Haldeman&amp;#8217;s 1975 science-fiction novel &lt;i&gt;The Forever War,&lt;/i&gt; he postulated a &amp;#8220;stasis field&amp;#8221; that forced his space marines to rely on nothing more than Roman military technologies, &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Military_institutions_of_Vegetius_in_fiv/sQlXAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=inauthor:%22Flavius+VEGETIUS+RENATUS%22&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover\"&gt;like javelins&lt;/a&gt;. We should be thinking in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;NATO isn&amp;#8217;t yet &lt;a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/22/nato-we-want-to-go-to-war-with-you/\"&gt;allowing&lt;/a&gt; civilians not employed by NATO or associated military contractors access to their training cyber ranges where vulnerabilities could be discovered and remediated before battlefield deployment. Last year, one of us (Tarah) was listening to a NATO briefing after the end of the &lt;a href=\"https://shape.nato.int/news-releases/exercise-cyber-coalition-2020\"&gt;2020 Cyber Coalition&lt;/a&gt; exercises, and asked how she and other information security researchers could volunteer to test cyber ranges used to train its cyber incident response force. She was told that including civilians would be a &amp;#8220;welcome thought experiment in the tabletop exercises,&amp;#8221; but including them in reality wasn&amp;#8217;t considered. There is a rich opportunity for improvement here, providing transparency into where improvements could be made.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Second, it&amp;#8217;s time to take cybersecurity seriously in military procurement, from weapons systems to logistics and communications contracts. In the three year span from the original 2018 GAO report to this year&amp;#8217;s report, cybersecurity audit compliance went from 0% to 40% (those 2 of 5 programs mentioned earlier). We need to get much better. DOD &lt;a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3535797/the-cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-explained-what-defense-contractors-need-to-know.html\"&gt;requires&lt;/a&gt; that its contractors and suppliers follow the &lt;a href=\"https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/\"&gt;Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification&lt;/a&gt; process; it should abide by the same standards. Making those standards both more rigorous and mandatory would be an obvious second step.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Gone are the days when we can pretend that our technologies will work in the face of a military cyberattack. Securing our systems will make everything we buy more expensive &amp;#8212; maybe a lot more expensive. But the alternative is no longer viable.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The future of war is cyberwar. If your weapons and systems aren&amp;#8217;t secure, don&amp;#8217;t even bother bringing them onto the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;This essay was written with Tarah Wheeler, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/hacked-drones-and-busted-logistics-are-the-cyber-future-of-warfare/\"&gt;previously appeared&lt;/a&gt; in Brookings TechStream.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a good ruling, and one that will benefit security researchers. But the confusing part is footnote 8:&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For present purposes, we need not address whether this inquiry turns only on technological (or “code-based”) limitations on access, or instead also looks to limits contained in contracts or policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this is exactly what the ruling does address. The court overturned the conviction because the defendant was not limited by technology, but only by policies. So that footnote doesn&amp;#8217;t make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#8217;t the first time cloud services were the focus of a cyberattack, and it certainly won&amp;#8217;t be the last. Cloud weaknesses were also &lt;a href=\"https://www.securonix.com/web/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Securonix_Threat_Research_Capital_One_Cyberattack.pdf\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; in a 2019 breach at &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/business/capital-one-data-breach/index.html\"&gt;Capital One&lt;/a&gt;. There, an Amazon Web Services cloud vulnerability, &lt;a href=\"https://blog.cloudsploit.com/a-technical-analysis-of-the-capital-one-hack-a9b43d7c8aea\"&gt;compounded&lt;/a&gt; by Capital One&amp;#8217;s own &lt;a href=\"https://www.cloudpassage.com/articles/preventing-a-capital-one-cloud-data-breach/\"&gt;struggle&lt;/a&gt; to properly configure a complex cloud service, led to the disclosure of tens of &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/business/capital-one-data-breach/index.html\"&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt; of customer records, including credit card applications, Social Security numbers, and bank account information.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/broken-trust-lessons-from-sunburst/\"&gt;trend of attacks&lt;/a&gt; on cloud services by criminals, hackers, and nation states is &lt;a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/report-attacks-cloud-services/\"&gt;growing&lt;/a&gt; as cloud computing takes over worldwide as the default model for information technologies. Leaked data is bad enough, but disruption to the cloud, even an outage at a single provider, could quickly cost the global economy &lt;a href=\"https://www.lloyds.com/~/media/files/news-and-insight/risk-insight/2018/cloud-down/aircyberlloydspublic2018final.pdf\"&gt;billions of dollars a day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is an important source of risk both because it has quickly supplanted traditional IT and because it concentrates ownership of design choices at a very small number of companies. First, cloud is increasingly the default mode of computing for organizations, meaning ever more users and critical data from national intelligence and defense agencies ride on these technologies. Second, cloud computing services, especially those supplied by the world&amp;#8217;s four largest providers &amp;#8212; Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, and Google &amp;#8212; concentrate key security and technology design choices inside a small number of organizations. The consequences of bad decisions or poorly made trade-offs can quickly scale to hundreds of millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The cloud is everywhere. Some cloud companies provide software as a service, support your Netflix habit, or carry your Slack chats. Others provide computing infrastructure like business databases and storage space. The largest cloud companies provide both.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The cloud can be deployed in several different ways, each of which shift the balance of responsibility for the security of this technology. But the cloud provider plays an important role in every case. Choices the provider makes in how these technologies are designed, built, and deployed &lt;a href=\"https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/forms/gated-form.html?docID=59d987b2-5df5-4fa2-a6b3-f9f7c204140f\"&gt;influence the user&amp;#8217;s security&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; yet the user has very little influence over them. Then, if Google or Amazon has a vulnerability in their servers &amp;#8212; which you are unlikely to know about and have no control over &amp;#8212; you suffer the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The problem is one of economics. On the surface, it might seem that competition between cloud companies gives them an incentive to invest in their users&amp;#8217; security. But several market failures &lt;a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/opinion/solarwinds-hack.html\"&gt;get in the way&lt;/a&gt; of that ideal. First, security is largely an externality for these cloud companies, because the losses due to data breaches are largely borne by their users. As long as a cloud provider isn&amp;#8217;t losing customers by the droves &amp;#8212; which generally doesn&amp;#8217;t happen after a security incident &amp;#8212; it is incentivized to underinvest in security. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"https://www.napier.ac.uk/~/media/worktribe/output-1476796/impact-of-cyber-attacks-on-stock-performance-a-comparative-study.pdf\"&gt;data shows&lt;/a&gt; that investors don&amp;#8217;t punish the cloud service companies either: Stock price dips after a public security breach are both small and temporary.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Second, public information about cloud security generally doesn&amp;#8217;t share the design trade-offs involved in building these cloud services or provide much transparency about the resulting risks. While cloud companies have to publicly disclose copious amounts of security design and operational information, it can be impossible for consumers to understand which threats the cloud services are taking into account, and how. This lack of understanding makes it hard to assess a cloud service&amp;#8217;s overall security. As a result, customers and users aren&amp;#8217;t able to differentiate between secure and insecure services, so they don&amp;#8217;t base their buying and use decisions on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Third, cybersecurity is complex &amp;#8212; and even more complex when the cloud is involved. For a customer like a company or government agency, the security dependencies of various cloud and on-premises network systems and services can be subtle and hard to map out. This means that users can&amp;#8217;t adequately assess the security of cloud services or how they will interact with their own networks. This is a classic &amp;#8220;lemons market&amp;#8221; in economics, and the &lt;a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_fall19_12_geer.pdf\"&gt;result&lt;/a&gt; is that cloud providers provide variable levels of security, as documented by Dan Geer, the chief information security officer for In-Q-Tel, and Wade Baker, a professor at Virginia Tech&amp;#8217;s College of Business, when they looked at the prevalence of severe security findings at the top 10 largest cloud providers. Yet most consumers are none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The result is a market failure where cloud service providers don&amp;#8217;t compete to provide the best security for their customers and users at the lowest cost. Instead, cloud companies take the chance that they won&amp;#8217;t get hacked, and past experience tells them they can weather the storm if they do. This kind of decision-making and priority-setting takes place at the executive level, of course, and doesn&amp;#8217;t reflect the dedication and technical skill of product engineers and security specialists. The effect of this underinvestment is pernicious, however, by piling on risk that&amp;#8217;s largely hidden from users. Widespread adoption of cloud computing carries that risk to an organization&amp;#8217;s network, to its customers and users, and, in turn, to the wider internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;This aggregation of cybersecurity risk creates a national security challenge. Policymakers &lt;a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/broken-trust-lessons-from-sunburst/\"&gt;can help&lt;/a&gt; address the challenge by setting clear expectations for the security of cloud services &amp;#8212; and for making decisions and design trade-offs about that security transparent. The Biden administration, including newly nominated National Cyber Director Chris Inglis, should lead an interagency effort to work with cloud providers to review their threat models and evaluate the security architecture of their various offerings. This effort to require greater transparency from cloud providers and exert more scrutiny of their security engineering efforts should be accompanied by a push to modernize cybersecurity regulations for the cloud era.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), which is the principal US government program for assessing the risk of cloud services and authorizing them for use by government agencies, would be a prime vehicle for these efforts. A recent executive order &lt;a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/everything-you-need-know-about-new-executive-order-cybersecurity\"&gt;outlines several steps&lt;/a&gt; to make FedRAMP faster and more responsive. But the program is still focused largely on the security of individual services rather than the cloud vendors&amp;#8217; deeper architectural choices and threat models. Congressional action should reinforce and extend the executive order by adding new obligations for vendors to provide transparency about design trade-offs, threat models, and resulting risks. These changes could help transform FedRAMP into a more effective tool of security governance even as it becomes faster and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Cloud providers have become important national infrastructure. Not since the heights of the mainframe era between the 1960s and early 1980s has the world witnessed computing systems of such complexity used by so many but designed and created by so few. The security of this infrastructure demands greater transparency and public accountability &amp;#8212; if only to match the consequences of its failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
